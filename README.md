# MakaiDev

Makai Rentals is a service platform that deployed B2B SaaS that streamlines the self-service rental process that allows users to navigate the rental process without the need for on-site staff. Makai is a MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code i can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the contact email service and survey builder features.
